  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>This tutorial aims to show you how to inject resources into Akka actors
    using Guice. You will be guided through the different parts used to
    integrate Akka with Guice and also create a test wrapper for a service
    and rewire the service used during testing without any code changes needed
    to the actor or the application classes.
  </p>

  <h2> Application Overview</h2>

  <p>The application consist of an actor defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingActor.scala</a>
    file. This actor uses a service defined in the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingService.scala"
    class="shortcut">CountingService.scala</a> file to increment a
    value. <code>CountingService</code> also uses <code>AuditCompanion</code> actor which in turn uses
    <code>AuditBus</code> actor. Audit actors are defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/Audit.scala" class="shortcut"> Audit.scala</a> file.
    Service and actor dependencies are wired via Guice.
  </p>

  <p>Note that <code>ActorRef</code>s are injected using top-level actors. This should be used sparingly to wire-up
  only top level components.</p>

  <p>To drive the actor, there is a application defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut">
    Main.scala</a> file that does the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Initializes Guice</li>
      <li>Obtains the actor system from Guice</li>
      <li>Creates two <code>CountingActor</code> instances via the Guice extension to demonstrate <code>ActorRef</code> injection scopes</li>
      <li>Sends a couple of messages to the actors so that it uses the
        <code>CountingService</code></li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Running the Application</h2>

  <p>The result of running the <code>Main</code> application is shown in the
    <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "Got back 3" for the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut"> Main.scala
    </a> application. You can also see output of the <code>AuditBus</code> actor,
    which demonstrates that <code>AuditBus</code> actor is created in <code>Singleton</code>
    scope and <code>AuditCompanion</code> is created every time new <code>CountingActor</code> is
    instantiated.
  </p>

  <h2>Running the Test</h2>

  <p>There is also a ScalaTest test for the <code>CountingActor</code> located in
    the <a href="#code/src/test/scala/CountingActorSpec.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingActorSpec.scala</a> file. It is structured in the same way as
    the <code>Main</code> application.
  </p>

  <p>The result of running the <code>CountingActorSpec</code> test is shown in the
    <a href="#test" class="shortcut">Test</a> tab. On the left-hand side we can
    see the console output, which is "passed CountingActorSpec".
  </p>
</div>

  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Akka Extension</h2>

  <p>To be able to use the Guice application context to let Guice create and
    wire up our actors, we need to store it away in a place that is easily
    accessible from within the actor system. This is an ideal use case for what
    is called an <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.0/scala/extending-akka.html">
    Akka Extension</a>. An extension can be thought of as a per actor system
    singleton and the one in this tutorial is defined in the <a
    href="#code/src/main/scala/akkaguice/GuiceAkkaExtension.scala" class="shortcut">
    GuiceAkkaExtension.scala</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The extension consist of two parts. The <code>GuiceAkkaExtension</code> class
    that defines the methods used by Akka to create the extension for an actor
    system, and the <code>GuiceAkkaExtensionImpl</code> class that defines the
    methods and fields available on the extension.
  </p>

  <p>On this extension, the <code>GuiceAkkaExtensionImpl</code> class, there
    are only two methods, <code>initialize(injector: Injector)</code>
    that is used during startup to initialize the extension with the right
    Guice injector, and <code>props(actorName: String)</code>
    that constructs a <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.0/scala/actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> from an actor name, that is used to create an actor.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>Props</code> creation uses the <code>GuiceActorProducer</code>
    that we will talk about next.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Guice Actor Producer</h2>

  <p>To let Guice create the actor from a bean name we need a way to allow the
    Akka <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.0/scala/actors.html#Props">
    Props</a> to delegate actor creation to Guice. This is done in the <a
    href="#code/src/main/scala/akkaguice/GuiceActorProducer.scala" class="shortcut">
    GuiceActorProducer.scala</a> file.
  </p>

  <p>The <code>GuiceActorProducer</code> implements the <a
    href="http://doc.akka.io/japi/akka/2.4.0/akka/actor/IndirectActorProducer.html">
    <code>IndirectActorProducer</code></a> interface which is a way to let the
    actor be <a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.4.0/scala/actors.html#Dependency_Injection">
    created via a factory method</a>. This interface has two methods that need
    to be implemented, <code>actorClass</code> that will return the type of the
    actor that will be created, and <code>produce</code>, that needs to create
    a new actor instance every time that it is called.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Exploring the Code: The Guice Application Configuration</h2>

  <p>To tie everything together, we have a Guice injector defined in the
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/Main.scala" class="shortcut">
    Main.scala</a> file. The injector references the various pieces of the
    application:
    <ol>
      <li>a <a href="#code/src/main/scala/config/ConfigModule.scala" class="shortcut">
          ConfigModule.scala</a> to inject a Typesafe Config object where necessary,
      </li>
      <li>an <a href="#code/src/main/scala/akkaguice/AkkaModule.scala" class="shortcut">
          AkkaModule.scala</a> to create an ActorSystem and initialize the Guice
          extension,
      </li>
      <li>a <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/SampleModule.scala" class="shortcut">
          SampleModule.scala</a> to bind the sample counting actor and service.
      </li>
        <li>and a <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/AuditModule.scala" class="shortcut">
            AuditModule.scala</a> to bind the <code>ActorRef</code> of Audit actors.
        </li>
    </ol>

  </p>

  <p>The <code>AkkaModule</code> has a <code>ActorSystemProvider</code> that
    is responsible for creating the ActorSystem in this Guice application, and
    the module binds the system as an eager singleton, which is useful to detect
    errors early in the application startup. The code creates the actor system and
    then initializes the <code>GuiceAkkaExtension</code> with the injector needed
    by the <code>GuiceActorProducer</code> to create actor instances from actor
    names. Note that the injector is itself injected by Guice into the <code>
    ActorSystemProvider</code>.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h2>Testing the Counting Service</h2>

  <p>Since we want to be able to test our actor thoroughly, let's use a test
    counting service. In our tutorial it will just wrap the real counting
    service and do some extra book keeping, but it could just as easily be a
    complete mock of the service.
  </p>

  <p>Lets take a closer look at the test counting service in the
    file <a href="#code/src/test/scala/TestCountingService.scala" class="shortcut">
    TestCountingService.scala</a>
  </p>

  <p>The class <code>TestCountingService</code> inherits from <code>
    CountingService</code> and overrides the method <code>increment</code> on
    line 9. In that method it keeps track of how many times it has been
    called, by using an internal counter named <code>called</code> and then it
    delegates to the real counting service by calling <code>super.increment(count)</code>
  </p>

  <p>It also has a method named <code>getNumberOfCalls</code> on line 14 that
    returns the value of the internal counter <code>called</code> that can be
    used during testing to verify how the service is being used by the actor.
  </p>

  <p>Open the <a href="#code/src/test/scala/CountingActorSpec.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingActorSpec.scala</a> file. At line 55, a test module that
    binds the <code>TestCountingService</code> to <code>CountingService</code> is added
    to our Guice configuration. The <code>TestCountingService</code> is defined in
    Singleton scope so that we can retrieve the same instance in the test as was used
    by the actor. The injector is created by the test with the basic required modules.
    Each test can also initialize the injector with the additional modules that may be
    required for testing.</p>

  <p>The test verifies the right number of calls are made to the test service at line
    74. It also verifies the audit companion is receiving audit messages at line 89 by
    mocking out the AuditCompanion actor using a Guice module that injects the
    TestProbe actor in its place.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusions</h2>

  <p>You now have a working sample that uses Guice to inject a service or a
    test service into an actor. Feel free to experiment and change the actor
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingActor.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingActor.scala</a>, service
    <a href="#code/src/main/scala/sample/CountingService.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingService.scala</a>, test service
    <a href="#code/src/test/scala/TestCountingService.scala" class="shortcut">
    TestCountingService.scala</a> and test
    <a href="#code/src/test/scala/CountingActorSpec.scala" class="shortcut">
    CountingActorSpec.scala</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The Akka extension <a href="#code/src/main/scala/akkaguice/GuiceAkkaExtension.scala" class="shortcut">
    GuiceAkkaExtension.scala</a>, the actor producer <a
    href="#code/src/main/scala/akkaguice/GuiceActorProducer.scala" class="shortcut">
    GuiceActorProducer.scala</a> and the application modules can be reused as the basis
    for your own Guice Akka application.</p>
